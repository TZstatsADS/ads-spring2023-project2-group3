The files in this folder contain the outputs of data analysis R files from the lib folder. These outputted files are used for the visualizations in the shiny app. The original data sets that are used for this analysis are too large to be uploaded, but can be found at the following two links:

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e

(We had to use a smaller, randomized sample from the above data set to get the shiny app to load. It is still too large to be uploaded to GitHub, however.)
